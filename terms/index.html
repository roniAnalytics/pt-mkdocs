                            To utilize certain Services, you must possess accounts with third-party service providers
                            (e.g., digital assets exchanges) ("Third Party Accounts") and use relevant credentials to
                            connect them to your Account. You assert that each Third Party Account connected to your
                            Account is solely owned and controlled by you.
                            <br>
                            We bear no responsibility for Third Party Accounts, including their creation, maintenance,
                            operation, availability, or termination. Your relationship with third parties is separate
                            from your relationship with us, and you agree to adhere to all relevant terms and
                            conditions.
                            <br>
                            We may receive referral fees or commissions for Third Party Account creation or subsequent
                            activities, which do not affect these Terms of Service.
                            <br>
                            If a third party requests the restriction of your Account, we may do so at our discretion.
                            <br>
                            The availability of Third Party Account connections depends on your subscription type and
                            Services provided by us. We reserve the right to vary such provisions or restrictions.
                            <br>
                            We may disconnect Third Party Accounts from your Account at any time. We are not responsible

                            Descriptions of our Services' subscriptions ("Plans") along with their prices and associated
                            functions are available on our website. By purchasing a Subscription, you agree to adhere to
                            these Terms of Service applicable to that Subscription, including fees, duration, features,
                            and any specified terms. Any additional Subscriptions added will commence immediately upon
                            payment, potentially adjusting existing Subscription terms unless otherwise stated.
                            <br>
                            We retain the right to modify Plan features, pricing, and range at our discretion. When
                            altering or removing a Plan affecting your Subscription(s), reasonable notice will be
                            provided.
                            <br>
                            Various payment options for Subscriptions may be offered. We do not guarantee the
                            availability of any payment method and may modify or suspend them at our discretion. Failure
                            to receive payment will deem you not to have Subscribed for that Service.
                            <br>
                            Automatic renewal may be offered for some Subscriptions, while others terminate at the end
                            of the subscription period. Automatic renewal implies your consent to renew and authorize
                            payment. Prices and fees exclude taxes unless explicitly stated otherwise.
                            <br>
                            You confirm that your payment information is accurate, and you are authorized to use the
                            provided payment method. Charges incurred will be honored by your payment method's issuer.
                            We strive for accurate price information but reserve the right to correct errors and
                            inaccuracies. Third-party service providers may process payments for our Services, and your
                            relationship with them is separate from ours.
                            <br>
                            Refunds or credits may be provided under specific circumstances and in accordance with our
                            refund policy, if applicable, and any applicable laws.

                            These Terms of Service are governed by English law. Disputes will be settled in English
                            courts, unless we opt for arbitration.
                            <br>
                            Arbitration may be required by written notice to you. If proceedings have begun, they will
                            be stayed, and arbitration will be pursued.
