                        <p style="font-size:medium;">
                            Depending on applicable law (in particular, whether the laws of the UK or EEA countries
                            apply), you may have the right to ask us for a copy of personal data about you; to correct
                            or delete that personal data; restrict the processing of that personal data; and to obtain a
                            copy of personal data about you that you provided to us (in connection with our agreement
                            with you, or with your consent), in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to
                            port this data to (i.e. share that data with) another organisation.
                            <br>
                            In addition, applicable law may provide the right to object to the processing of personal
                            data about you, in some circumstances (in particular, where we don't have to process the
                            data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for
                            direct marketing).
                            <br>
                            You have the right to appeal the result of significant fully automated decisions. This
                            should be done by emailing us within 3 working days from the date of the decision, which we
                            will then review.
                            <br>
                            If these rights apply, they may however be limited, for example if fulfilling your request
                            would reveal personal data about another person, would infringe the rights of another person
                            or legal entity (including our rights), or if you ask us to delete or change data which we
                            are required by law to keep (or have other compelling legitimate interests in keeping). We
                            will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.
                            <br>
                            To exercise any of these rights, or to obtain other information, such as a copy of a
                            legitimate interests balancing test, you can get in touch using the details set out below.
                            If you have unresolved concerns, you typically have the right to complain to regulators,
                            depending on applicable law. For example, in the EEA, your complaint can likely be taken to
                            data protection authorities where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have
                            occurred.
